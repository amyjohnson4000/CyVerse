CyVerse Coding Challenge

Steps:
1)	Read up on Nats.io and Kubernetes, learn about the overall system architecture.
Information on Nats.io:
https://docs.nats.io/nats-concepts/what-is-nats
Information on Kubernetes:
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/
2)	Download nats through visual studio, using NuGet
Look at example code, try to understand it, and try to get some code working.  For example, one resource used: https://github.com/nats-io/nats.net
3)	In this case, I attempted to set up a nats connection, publish an event, and subscribe to the event.
4)	I was not able to connect to nats (time out exception was thrown)
